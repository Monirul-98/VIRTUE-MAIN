  - 4-6 images per project (30 total gallery images across all projects)

---

## 6. General Implementation Notes

- **Framer Motion:** All major content blocks on both `projects/page.tsx` and `projects/[slug]/page.tsx` are wrapped in `<FadeY>` for a consistent scroll-reveal animation effect. Staggered delays are used for lists and grids.
- **Next.js Image Component:** Used for all images to ensure optimization, lazy loading, and responsive sizing.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utilized for all styling, ensuring a consistent design system.
- **Accessibility:** Semantic HTML, `alt` attributes for images, and proper link/button usage.
- **Error Handling:** `notFound()` is used on the detail page if a project slug is invalid.
- **SEO:** Dynamic metadata generation for each project page.
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach with responsive grids and layouts.

## 7. Content Strategy

**Project Selection Criteria:**

## 8. Next Steps

1. **Add Placeholder Images:** Populate the `/public/images/projects/` directory with the specified images.
2. **Review Content:** Ensure all project descriptions, specs, and testimonials are accurate and compelling.
3. **Test Navigation:** Verify that all links between the projects index and detail pages work correctly.
4. **Responsive Testing:** Check layout and animations across various screen sizes.
5. **Add Filtering:** Implement category filtering on the projects index page (currently visual only).
6. **Optimize Images:** Ensure all images are properly optimized before deployment.
7. **Legal Review:** Verify client names and project details are approved for public display.
